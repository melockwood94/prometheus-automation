                <p>We here at Prometheus Automation come from a varied background with resources and knowledge spanning multiple markets and business areas. 
                    Despite our varied backgrounds, we all have one thing in common. We see a need to utilize emerging technologies to free people from repetitive 
                    and tedious tasks. We believe in educating users to find ways to become more efficient and look at ways to automate and streamline processes.
